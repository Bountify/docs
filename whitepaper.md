# Bountify: Realize Abundance

## Why Bountify?

We live in a world of abundance, and yet, many if not most people do not feel that way--they feel cut off from the basic necessities that would foster a fulfilling and happy life. While most people would agree that the Beatles nailed it when they sang "money can't buy me love," many are trapped in the belief that a lack of money is a major obstacle in their quest to meet their day-to-day needs and those of their families. At the same time, enormous wealth is all around us and goes unused because we have lost the social ties and culture of mutual support that knit communities together as far back as we can remember. Bountify aims to help people realize a life of abundance by reinvigorating a gift culture in both our geographical and virtual communities. It will do so by helping people become aware of their own needs and gifts, as well as the needs and gifts of those around them, and then facilitating connection between these people.

## The Problem

We have a scarcity mindset. As author and speaker [Charles Eisenstein wrote](http://charleseisenstein.net/a-beautiful-world-of-abundance/):

> Scarcity is one of the defining features of modern life. Around the world, one in five children suffers from hunger. We fight wars over scarce resources such as oil. We have depleted the oceans of fish, and the ground of clean water. Worldwide, people and governments are cutting back, making do with less, because of a scarcity of money. Few would deny that we live in an era of scarce resources; many would say it is dangerous to imagine otherwise.

And it is not just things like food, oil, water, and money that we believe are scarce--we also perceive a woeful shortage of things like kindness, intelligence, generosity, creativity, and talent in the world around us. It is not surprising that we believe this. As Sir Ken Robinson explains in [his wonderful TED talk on why schools kill creativity](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity):

> Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that.... Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist. Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly-talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way.

In other words, we've been taught that unless an activity will lead to getting a job or otherwise making money, it's not worth doing. We've also been taught that there's not enough stuff in the world to go around. The "law of supply and demand" tells us that there is a limited supply of stuff in the world, and the more scarce it is, and the more people want it, the higher its value. While this observation is probably valid for setting monetary prices, it has led to a perverse notion that if a thing is either plentiful, or free (like a hug or a sunset), it must not be valuable.

Consequently, many of us feel lonely and poor. We refrain from doing things that we love because we can't make any money doing it.

In addition to our scarcity mindset, a second problem involves our willingness to ask for help, to let other people know when we are in need.

## Core Philosophy

Bountify is based on some assumptions about our world that may seem counterintuitive:

1. There really is enough stuff to go around.
2. People really do want to provide it to each other.
3. If we can make people aware of each other's gifts and needs, and 
4. If we can remove money from the equation, 
5. It will open up the flow of resources.

## What do we mean by "gift?"

Our definition of "gift" is extremely broad and is essentially:

> A **gift** is any resource which can meet the needs of oneself or another

In practice, a gift could be:

1. A Skill or Talent (particularly one that you enjoy!)
2. A Material Possession
3. Time
4. Information or Experience

I envision the site will be like KickStarter or IndieGoGo only at a much more micro scale. I'd like to offload as much of the responsibility for interaction to other sites like Facebook or through media like email, text, and phone. There should be some sort of community-enforced culture, as with StackExchange. There will have to be some sort of tagging/categorization scheme to help with the matching algorithm. The taxonomy should be curated by the community, and much like the review process in SE, you'll have to earn the right to participate in this aspect of the community, and we'll use a voting process so decisions don't all fall to individuals. If people do things like shop for one another, they can send money to each other using any number of services like through Facebook or via paypal. The risks for doing this kind of stuff must be borne by the individuals. We're sorry if you lose money, but we should have some sort of recommended best practices for getting into that kind of arrangement.

Needs can be one-shot or ongoing. They can be fulfilled by people locally or perhaps remotely. Some will require high coordination and/or trust, and others little to none at all.

We need a way to track need fulfillment.
